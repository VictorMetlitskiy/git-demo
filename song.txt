Five little ducks went out one day

Over the hill and far away

Mother duck said, “Quack, quack, quack, quack”

But only four little ducks came back

One, two, three, four

Four little ducks went out one day

Over the hill and far away

Mother duck said, “Quack, quack, quack, quack”

But only three little ducks came back
